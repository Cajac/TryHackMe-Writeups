# SOC Level 1 (Legacy) Learning Path

```text
Type: Learning Path
Difficulty: Easy
Description:
This path will introduce a wide array of tools and real-life analysis scenarios, enabling 
you to become a successful Junior Security Analyst.

This path is now considered legacy and will soon be replaced by a new path. The refreshed 
path is a major upgrade and includes a deeper dive into endpoint and network threats, 
better explains security operations and SIEM triage, and omits some forensic topics rarely 
observed in SOC routines.
