## Solution

### Task 2 - Security Analyst

Security analysts are integral to constructing security measures across organisations to protect the company  
from attacks. Analysts explore and evaluate company networks to uncover actionable data and recommendations  
for engineers to develop preventative measures. This job role requires working with various stakeholders to  
gain an understanding of security requirements and the security landscape.

### Task 3 - Security Engineer

Security engineers develop and implement security solutions using threats and vulnerability data - often  
sourced from members of the security workforce. Security engineers work across circumventing a breadth of  
attacks, including web application attacks, network threats, and evolving trends and tactics. The ultimate  
goal is to retain and adopt security measures to mitigate the risk of attack and data loss.

### Task 4 - Incident Responder

Incident responders respond productively and efficiently to security breaches. Responsibilities include creating  
plans, policies, and protocols for organisations to enact during and following incidents. This is often a highly  
pressurised position with assessments and responses required in real-time, as attacks are unfolding.

### Task 5 - Digital Forensics Examiner

If you like to play detective, this might be the perfect job. If you are working as part of a law-enforcement  
department, you would be focused on collecting and analysing evidence to help solve crimes: charging the guilty  
and exonerating the innocent. On the other hand, if your work falls under defending a company's network, you will  
be using your forensic skills to analyse incidents, such as policy violations.

### Task 6 - Malware Analyst

A malware analyst's work involves analysing suspicious programs, discovering what they do and writing reports  
about their findings. A malware analyst is sometimes called a reverse-engineer as their core task revolves  
around converting compiled programs from machine language to readable code, usually in a low-level language.  
This work requires the malware analyst to have a strong programming background, especially in low-level languages  
such as assembly language and C language. The ultimate goal is to learn about all the activities that a malicious  
program carries out, find out how to detect it and report it.

### Task 7 - Penetration Tester

You may see penetration testing referred to as pentesting and ethical hacking. A penetration tester's job role  
is to test the security of the systems and software within a company - this is achieved through attempts to  
uncover flaws and vulnerabilities through systemised hacking. Penetration testers exploit these vulnerabilities  
to evaluate the risk in each instance. The company can then take these insights to rectify issues to prevent a  
real-world cyberattack.

### Task 8 - Red Teamer

Red teamers share similarities to penetration testers, with a more targeted job role. Penetration testers look  
to uncover many vulnerabilities across systems to keep cyber-defence in good standing, whilst red teamers are  
enacted to test the company's detection and response capabilities. This job role requires imitating cyber  
criminals' actions, emulating malicious attacks, retaining access, and avoiding detection. Red team assessments  
can run for up to a month, typically by a team external to the company.
