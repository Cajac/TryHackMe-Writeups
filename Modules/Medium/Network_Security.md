# Network Security Module

```text
Type: Module
Difficulty: Medium
Description:
Learn the basics of passive and active network reconnaissance. Understand how common protocols work 
and their attack vectors.

In this module, we will learn about the different tools and online services for passive reconnaissance 
and how to leverage various basic programs for active reconnaissance. We will cover Nmap (a network 
scanning tool) in detail, including discovering live hosts, advanced port-scanning, OS and service 
version detection, running Nmap scripts and saving scan results. Finally, we will dive into the 
commonly found protocols to better understand their inner workings and the potential attacks and 
mitigations.
