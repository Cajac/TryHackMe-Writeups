# Privilege Escalation Module

```text
Type: Module
Difficulty: Medium
Description:
Learn the fundamental techniques that will allow you to elevate account privileges in Linux 
and windows systems.

Privilege escalation allows you to increase your rights on the target system. Privilege 
escalation is the path that will take you from a limited user account to complete system 
dominance. This module covers effective techniques you can use to increase the privilege 
level of the user you have on the target system. Techniques used in Linux and Windows are 
covered separately with examples you can face in CTFs, certification exams, or penetration 
testing engagements.
