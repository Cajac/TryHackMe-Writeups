# Cyber Threat Intelligence Module

```text
Type: Module
Difficulty: Easy
Description:
Learn about identifying and using available security knowledge to mitigate and manage 
potential adversary actions.

Cybersecurity today is about adversaries and defenders finding ways to outplay each 
other in a never-ending game of cat and mouse. Because of that, a lot of attack data 
is generated, which needs analysis to produce actionable information that defenders 
can act upon to thwart future attacks. That process is known as cyber threat 
intelligence. We'll explore threat intelligence concepts, including its lifecycle, 
various frameworks used, and a few open-source tools used to analyse malicious 
activities. We'll look closely at some notable platforms that share and manage 
collected intelligence in MISP and OpenCTI.
