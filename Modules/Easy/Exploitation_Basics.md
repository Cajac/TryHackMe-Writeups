# Exploitation Basics Module

```text
Type: Module
Difficulty: Easy
Description:
Discover the art of exploitation by leveraging a real-world vulnerability. Next, 
explore the exploitation features of the Metasploit framework.

In this module, we present the foundational knowledge of exploiting vulnerabilities. 
We exploit a vulnerability and compromise a machine without using any exploitation 
framework. Then, we learn how to use Metasploit, a widely used framework that 
simplifies the process of exploiting vulnerabilities. Ultimately, you will use the 
knowledge learned in the module to exploit a vulnerable Windows machine.
