Description:
Analyse malicious files to prevent malicious actions and identify attacks.

An unknown binary is running on a workstation. You obtain the MD5 hash and search online, but you 
can't find any information about it. Virustotal only shows 1 hit that it's malware. Time to dig 
in and find out for yourself. Malware analysis is the process of analyzing binaries to determine 
its functionality. This module will explore the tools and techniques used to analyse potential 
malware.
