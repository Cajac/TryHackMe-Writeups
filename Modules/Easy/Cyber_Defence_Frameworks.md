# Cyber Defence Frameworks Module

```text
Type: Module
Difficulty: Easy
Description:
Discover frameworks and policies that help establish a good security posture. Learn how 
organisations use these in defensive strategies.

It is vital to understand the stages of an attack and the techniques an adversary employs. 
Understanding the steps taken during an incident helps create an appropriate response and 
investigate why and how the incident occurred. Applying policies, frameworks and models, 
such as the Cyber Kill Chain model, can improve an organisation's defensive posture.
