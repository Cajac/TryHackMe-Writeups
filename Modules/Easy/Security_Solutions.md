# Security Solutions Module

```text
Type: Module
Difficulty: Easy
Description:
Explore fundamental defensive security solutions like firewalls, IDS, vulnerability 
scanners, and SIEM through different hands-on exercises.

In this module, you will learn how essential defensive security solutions work, such 
as firewalls, Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), vulnerability scanners, and Security 
Information and Event Management (SIEM). Through hands-on exercises, you will learn 
how to use firewalls to allow or block traffic, IDS to detect intrusions, vulnerability 
scanners to find vulnerabilities, and the SIEM solution to monitor centralized security 
events. This module will equip you with the arsenal to protect digital infrastructure.
