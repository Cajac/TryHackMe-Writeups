Learn the command line and MS PowerShell in Windows by practising various essential

Understanding command-line interfaces (CLI) is essential, as many security tools and 
tasks require their configuration and usage through them. CLIs are imperative for 
scripting and automation and can prove very helpful in carrying out penetration 
testing and incident analysis. This module will teach us how to use the command line 
and PowerShell in Windows and Bash in Linux.
